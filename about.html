    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Michael Corra is an American artist based in South Korea. He works with materials in their most direct form, letting color and texture lead rather than over-planning. Many of his paintings embrace the flaws of the process: visible brushstrokes, unpolished edges, and surfaces that show their making.</p>

    <p>Corra thinks through making — allowing ideas to develop in real time, in response to what’s happening on the surface. This openness keeps his process responsive rather than fixed. Most of his pieces are presented in frames he builds himself from found materials. These frames, often marked by their own histories and imperfections, extend the spirit of the paintings — blurring the line between artwork and object, and making each piece a singular, self-contained presence.</p>

    <p>In both his painting and framing, Corra works in the space between control and unpredictability, letting the finished work emerge as a conversation between chance and intention.</p>
