      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I am an artist inspired by the harmony of colour and emotion. My work
        explores the intersection between abstract expressionism and personal
        narrative, using bold strokes and vibrant palettes to convey feelings
        that words alone cannot. Every piece is an invitation for viewers to
        interpret their own story within the textures and hues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years I have experimented with oil, acrylic and mixed media on
        canvas. I believe that the medium should serve the message, and I choose
        materials that best express the energy of each idea. When you look at
        these paintings, you are seeing not only pigment on canvas but also the
        culmination of countless hours of contemplation and creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My artwork has been exhibited in regional galleries and international
        shows, and I have had the honour of receiving several awards for my
        contributions to contemporary abstract art. Through this website I hope
        to share my journey with you and connect with collectors and fellow art
        lovers around the world.
