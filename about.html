      <p>
        I work with materials in their most direct form, letting color and texture lead me rather than over-planning. Many of my paintings embrace the flaws of the process—visible brushstrokes, unpolished edges, and surfaces that reveal their making. I often think through making, letting each decision respond to what’s happening on the canvas in real time. Most of my work involves building my own frames from found materials, a choice that becomes part of the work’s meaning and physical presence. For me, painting is a conversation between chance and intention, where the process is as alive as the finished piece.
